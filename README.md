# Donuts with Voyager

Initial scribbles to have an event driven version of donuts

# Installation

To simplify the installation process of Donuts and MySQL, everything is containerised using Docker.
Docker depends on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2.0) and this is only available on Windows 10.

   1. Install/enable WSL2.0 - Add link to notes
   1. Install Docker desktop on your control PC
   1. Install Github desktop on youe control PC
   1. Clone the Donuts/Voyager git repository
      1. ```cd /path/where/donuts/will/live```
      1. ```git clone https://github.com/jmccormac01/donuts_voyager.git```
      1. ```cd donuts_voyager```
   1. Edit the ```docker-compose.yml``` file to set the following information for your system:
      1. On line 16 replace the ```/Users/jmcc/Dropbox/Docker/mysql``` section of the line (before the :) with the path to where you'd like to store the database contents
      1. Ensure that folder exists before continuing
   1. For security reasons, the MySQL database root password is not stored on github. Do the following to set a root password:
      1. ```cd /path/where/donuts/lives```
      1. ```mkdir secrets/```
      1. ```cd secrets/```
      1. Create a file called ```mysql_root``` with no file extension
      1. Inside that file save the desired root password.
      1. This root password file should not be commited to any git repository.
      1. Anything in the ```secrets/``` folder is automatically excluded from version control in the ```.gitignore``` file
      1. Once you've memorised the root password and have built donuts (see below) and ran it a few times (see further below), you should delete the ```secrets/mysql_root``` file.
   1. Build the Docker image for Donuts/Voyager
      1. ```docker build -t voyager_donuts .```

# Running Donuts

Eventually I'll get round to making Voyager run the Donuts Docker container but for now
during the testing phase we need to run the container manually using:

   1. ```cd /path/where/donuts/lives```
   1. ```docker compose up```

This command will fire up the following:

   1. The container inside which Donuts will run and interact with Voyager
   1. The MySQL database container
   1. The adminer container which allows interaction with the database via a browser on url ```localhost:8080```
      1. Users familiar with MySQL can log in as the user ```donuts``` to database ```donuts``` without a password
      1. You can also log in as user ```root``` using the password specified during installation.

# Voyager Configuration

   1. Make sure Voyager Application Server is turned on (SetupForm >> Voyager Tab >> Activate On Start (checked)).
   2. Set Voyager Path according to configs/configs.toml file (SetupForm >> Voyager Tab >> Path & File >> Sequence Path).
   3. Set Voyager Sequence Pattern (SetupForm >> Voyager Tab >> Path & File >> Sequence File Pattern >> Manage)
      ```$$VOYDATEFOLDER08$$\$$TARGETNAME$$_$$IMAGETYPE$$_$$FILTER$$_$$LABEL$$_$$EXPOSURETIME$$s_BIN$$BINNING$$_$$SENSORTEMP$$C_A$$ARRAYNODE$$_$$FRAMENR$$_$$VOYDATETIME$$_$$READOUTMODE$$_$$SPEED$$_RPA$$ROTATORPA$$_$$PIERSIDE$$_F$$ROBOFIREFOCUSERPOS$$```
   4. Set Sequence Sub Folder (Sequence Configuration >> Sequence Tab >> Sequence Sub Foldering/File Naming) to Use File Pattern.
